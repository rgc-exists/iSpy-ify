# iSpy-ify
Turns every level/menu into eye-bleeding brain candy like the hit level iSpyWithMyLittleEye by Voxicat!!!  
Also includes some funny "eye closing/opening" sections that randomly spawn as you play. :)

# The Blinking Eye (optional)
There is a feature where an eye appears and the level gets dark as it blinks (like that one part part in iSpy.)  
***You can disable that in the settings of the mod, just like any other setting for any Geode mod.***
